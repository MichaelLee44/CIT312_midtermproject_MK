            <h1>About Meals By Michael</h1>
            <p>
                Meals by Michael was founded by me, Michael Kellems. The idea behind Meals by Michael is that I am not a classically trained chef but I share a passion for home cooking.
                Through Meals by Michael, I try to share recipes I personally like to help foster the love of home cooking in other people. With that being said, lets get to cooking!
            </p>

            <p>
                You can find recipes on here, curated by myself, and request my services for whatever catering or other chef based needs you need! For more inqueries, contact me at
                ml.kellems61@gmail.com or +1 317 427 3653.
